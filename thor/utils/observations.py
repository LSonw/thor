    Parameters
    ----------
    times : `~astropy.time.core.Time`
        Observation times that need to be assigned to a linking window.
    length : float, int
        Length of the desired linking window in units of decimal days.

    -------
    window : `~numpy.ndarray` (N)
        The linking window number to which each time was assigned.

    Given a set of observation times, calculates the night

    Parameters
    ----------
    times : `~astropy.core.Time` (N)
        Observation times.
    local_midnight : float
        The change in time from UTC at which local midnight occurs for the observer
        or observatory that made the observations. This should be a float value in units
        of decimal days. For those locations East of the Prime Meridian these
        would be positive values (e.g., Brussels would be +1/24, Shanghai would be +8/24).
        For locations West of the Prime Meridian these values should be negative
        (e.g., New York would be -4/24, Seattle would be -7/24).

    Returns
    -------
    night : `~numpy.ndarray` (N)
        Night on which the observation was made expressed as an integer MJD.
